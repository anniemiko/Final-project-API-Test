Final Project App Idea

Habit Formation App

Users can create a profile, set the habits they want to start or quit
App tracks consecutive days of completing/avoiding the habit

When you set your habit, it asks what your motivation/reason for the habit is, and will remind you of this when you’re not doing well

Could also enter in reward idea for yourself if habit is completed

Can add article links, images, etc. to each habit (using Pocket API)
